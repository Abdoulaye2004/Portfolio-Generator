        Brooklyn Nets Page

      <p id="p1">
        I created a fan page for my favorite basketball team using basic HTML and CSS for this project. I'm proud of this project because it was my first introduction into coding, and looking back at it and seeing how far I've come is a source of great pride for me.

      <h3>
        Jeffs Blog
      </h3>
      <p id="p1">
        For this project, I created a personal blog for Jeff, but this time I used a lot more advince css and introduced myself to javscript by making a button that when you press it, a message appears, which was very basic javascript but still a lot of fun to code. I included this project because it was my first time doing mostly individual coding and seeing where I got, as well as my first time learning javscript.

      <h3>
        Figma Design
      </h3>
      <p id="p1">
        This project was by far the most difficult for me. What made this difficult was that I had missed the first class where figma was introduced, so I was already behind when this project was assigned. It was difficult for me to come up with a business idea while also creating a visually appealing layout. But the ending was more satisfying because I had created a page that, while not done by code, was still essentially a webpage layout that wasn't ugly to me and contained everything I desired.
